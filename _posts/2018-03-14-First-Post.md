Hello World! And welcome to my blog! My name is Eric and I am a broadcast engineer at Wisconsin Publc Radio! If you want to know more about me, head on over to my about page [Here](https://blog.bartos.media/about).

This blog is deticated to all the interesting things I do both at work and at home. I have plenty of very specific strange projects that I like to work on and I feel like this is going to be a great place to share them with the world. My plan going forward for this blog is to post at _least_ once every 2 weeks, and I really hope I can do more, because I have a whole lot of stuff to share.

If you like anything related to radio, computers, servers, coding, music, electronics, and much much more I hope you will enjoy this blog. as of right this second I dont have an exact date on when my first _real_ post will be published, but I'm shooting for this weekend. For your convienence I have setup a wonderful RSS feed that will include everything I ever post on this blog, as well as a handy dandy email list that I will update on all of my more...important...posts, like my first _real_ post.

If anything I have said keeps you interested, or if you are even still reading at this point, I would really appreciate it if you would subscribe to my email list or RSS feed, and maybe give me a quick follow on tiwtter! I promise I wont spam or sell your email, its just to keep my lovely readers like you up to date on my posts and happenings.

One final thing to note, this site design may evolve over time, I'd love to get some feedback, tweet me or leave a comment below with your thoughts!
