[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/djbartos93/BartosBlog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/djbartos93/BartosBlog)

You've stumbled across my blog repo here on github!

This blog was built with Jekyll and a modified version of the alembic theme, if you like the theme check it out here: https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic

I use TravisCI to deploy my blog onto my VPS hosted at [Thermo](https://thermo.io). If that build icon at the top is not green please let me know!
